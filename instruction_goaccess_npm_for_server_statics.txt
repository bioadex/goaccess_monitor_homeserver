first you need to have npm(nginx proxy manager) running with cloudflared 

if you do not have you can check my github to see how to create one using docker compose 

using docker compose create a docker-compose-goaccess.yml 

you can copy the yaml file 

run it 

first make sure that your npm and goaccess are on the same docker network

docker network ls     # check the npm network 

then get the npm logs by going to where you have npm logs 

start the goaccess yml 

docker compose -f docker-compose-goaccess.yml up -d 

docker ps    # to confirm if the goaccess is created 

if its created you can check the logs of the goaccess if there is no error 


if no error 

next step go to your cloudflared login then search for Tunnel 

then you need to create a hostname and others you can check on my github steps to do that or Youtube 

add the goaccess to the tunnel then enter IP address of your ubuntu server then SAVE 

go to npm url page then click on Hosts then Add Proxy Host 

add your goaccess just the way you add it on cloudflared 

choose http 
destination goaccess 
port 7880

enable Cache Assets 
enable Block Common Exploits 
enable Websockets Support 

then go to SSL 

generate SSL certificate if you do not have one but if you already have one select to add from the drop down 

enable Force SSL 
enable HTTP/2 Support 
enable HSTS Enabled 
enable HSTS Subdomains 

then SAVE

click the goaccess from the npm then you will be in the goaccess Dashboard 

if you set password you will be ask to enter your username and password to Login
